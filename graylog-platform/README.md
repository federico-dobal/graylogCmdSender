# Graylog command line publisher

## Overview
This project implements a command line application that reads events from a text file and publish them on Graylog by 
using the [GELF](https://docs.graylog.org/en/4.0/pages/gelf.html) message format.

## Technical implementation overview
The application relies on the following 2 features:
 - Parser 
   - in charge of parsing the file
   - Implemented in FileParser.java class 
 - Publisher
    - in charge of publishing an event into Graylog
    - Implemented in EventPublisher.java class 
  
The application solution is structured as follows:

1. Read the file from the file system
2. Parse the file by returning a list of Events
3. For each event:
    * convert the event to GELF format
    * Use /gelf API endpoint to publish the message on Graylog

## How to build the project?
The project can be build by executing:
    
     mvn clean install 

## How to execute the tests?
Tests are ran by executing:
         
          mvn test
          
## How to execute the parser?
TFollowing command execute the application. Thus the application publishes the messages on Graylog:
    
     java -jar ./target/graylog-sender.jar /path_to_file/sample-messages.txt

## Dependency
Currently the only dependency the application has is Graylog. It requires Graylog to be up and running healthy.

Graylog can be started by two options:

1. Build from the [repository](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server)
2. [Start using Docker](https://docs.graylog.org/en/4.0/pages/installation/docker.html)

Once it is up and running it can be accessed on http://127.0.0.1:9000/. In addition, it requires creating and input with type GELF HTTP.
## Verify messages are being published
In order to verify the application publishes messages successfully the Graylog UI can be helpful as well as its logs.
